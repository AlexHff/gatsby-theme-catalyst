# Theme-UI in Catalyst Themes

[Read about using theme-ui to customize a theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-03-customizing-styles-in-gatsby-themes-with-theme-ui/)

Theme-UI based design tokens are used throughout the Catalyst series of themes and starters as this is the suggested best practice when building Gatsby themes. A combination of straight exports and [deepmerge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepmerge) is used to manage the shadowing of design tokens. The files you should modify to set design tokens are always located in the following location in the starters:

    .
    ├── src
      ├── gatsby-plugin-theme-ui
        ├── breakpoints.js
        ├── colors.js
        ├── fonts.js
        ├── fontSizes.js
        ├── fontWeights.js
        ├── lineHeights.js
        ├── sizes.js
        ├── spaces.js
        ├── styles.js
        ├── variants.js

Try adding this code to the `colors.js` file and see what happens:

```
import merge from "deepmerge"
import { BaseThemeColors } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core"

export default merge(BaseThemeColors, {
  header: {
    background: "red",
    backgroundOpen: "pink",
    text: "yellow",
    textOpen: "white",
    icons: "purple",
    iconsHover: "green",
    iconsOpen: "white",
  },
})
```

### Typography and changing fonts

The default settings in the theme include a system font stack for both the body and headings. These themes do not use typography.js at this time.

To add a custom font you need to first add the font as a dependency in your starter site, like this for Raleway:

`yarn add typeface-raleway`

Then at the top of `src\gatsby-plugin-theme-ui\fonts.js` file you will need to import the font and declare it, like this for Raleway:

```
import merge from "deepmerge";
import { BaseThemeFonts } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core";
import "typeface-raleway";

export default merge(BaseThemeFonts, {
  //Updated theme options go here.
  fonts: {
      text: "Raleway, sans-serif",
      heading: "inherit",
      monospace: "Menlo, monospace",
    },
});
```

### Changing logo sizes

A common change you will need to make is to the logo size. The logo sizes are managed in the following location: `...src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/sizes.js`. In many cases the size of your logo will control the size of your navbar/header. There is also an option in the sizes file which can override the auto height inherited from content and specify a fixed height.

- [Component Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/)

This set of themes, at least right now, is more developer friendly and requires a basic working knowledge of GatsbyJS and web development in general. I have tried to make it as easy as possible however I assume you have some basic working knowledge of the command line, git, etc.

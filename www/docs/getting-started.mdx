# Getting Started

This set of themes, at least right now, is developer friendly and requires a basic working knowledge of GatsbyJS and web development. I have tried to make it as easy as possible however I assume you have a basic knowledge of the command line, git, etc.

### Using a gatsby-starter to implement the themes

All of these themes are available on NPM but the easiest way to get started is via a gatsby-starter that includes the theme(s) already. Currently the following starters are available:

**gatsby-starter-catalyst-core**: `gatsby new catalyst-core https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-core`

**gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic**: `gatsby new catalyst-basic https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic`

**gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer**: `gatsby new catalyst-writer https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer`

### Modifying Gatsby-Config.JS

Theme options are set via the `gatsby-config.js` file. Specifically the navigation menu, social links menu, author name, site title, etc. The starter sites come with some pre-configured options in here you can modify.

**Core Theme Options**

```
   {
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core`,
      options: {
        displaySiteLogo: true,
        displaySiteTitle: true,
        invertLogo: true,
        mobileMenuBreakpoint: "1024px",
        useStickyHeader: true,
        useHero: "true",
      }
    }
```

| Option                 | Values                      | Description                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contentPath`          | String                      | Defaults to "content/pages", determines where the pages are created from.                                 |
| `assetPath`            | String                      | Defaults to "content/assets", determines where the page assets like images are located.                   |
| `displaySiteLogo`      | true or false               | Controls whether the logo is displayed                                                                    |
| `displaySiteTitle`     | true or false               | Controls whether the site title is displayed                                                              |
| `invertLogo`           | true or false               | Controls whether the logo is inverted when the mobile menu is open                                        |
| `useHero`              | true or false               | Flag to include a hero component in the site.                                                             |
| `useStickyHeader`      | true or false               | Controls whether the header is sticky or static                                                           |
| `mobileMenuBreakpoint` | String value, e.g. "1024px" | Sets the breakpoint for displaying the mobile menu, works independent of other breakpoints set in ThemeUI |

### Social Links

This option in gatsby-config is a bit unique. You can specify a social media provider such as Twitter and also three different locations in the settings, `header`, `footer`, and `all` which will locate the icons appropriately. It will work with most major social platforms and has a fallback for displaying the text if a logo isn't pre-configured.

```
socialLinks: [
      {
        name: `Email`,
        link: `eric@erichowey.dev`,
        location: `footer`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
      {
        name: `Github`,
        link: `https://www.github.com/ehowey`,
        location: `all`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
      {
        name: `Twitter`,
        link: `https://www.twitter.com/erchwy`,
        location: `header`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
    ],
```

### Customizing the themes using Theme-UI and Design Tokens

[Read about using theme-ui to customize a theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-03-customizing-styles-in-gatsby-themes-with-theme-ui/)

Theme-UI based design tokens are used throughout the Catalyst series of themes and starters as this is the suggested best practice when building Gatsby themes. [Deepmerge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepmerge) is used to manage the shadowing of design tokens in the starters. The file you should modify to set design tokens is always located in the following location:

    .
    ├── src
      ├── gatsby-plugin-theme-ui
        ├── index.js

Try adding this code to the `index.js` file and see what happens:

```
import merge from "deepmerge"
import { BaseTheme } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core"
import { baseColors } from "@theme-ui/preset-tailwind"

export default merge(BaseTheme, {
  colors: {
    background: baseColors.pink[4],
  },
})
```

### Typography and changing fonts

To add a custom font you need to first add the font as a dependency in your starter site, for example:

`yarn add typeface-raleway`

Then at the top of `src\gatsby-plugin-theme-ui\index.js` file you will need to import the font and declare it, like this for Raleway:

```
import merge from "deepmerge"
import { BaseTheme } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core"
import "typeface-raleway"

export default merge(BaseTheme, {
  fonts: {
    body: "Raleway, sans-serif",
    heading: "inherit",
  },
})
```

### Changing logos and logo sizes

A common change you will need to make is to the logo and logo size.

The logo is found by default in the `src/content/assets` folder under the names `logo.png`. Change this file to reflect your branding.

The logo size is managed in the following location: `...src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`. In many cases the size of your logo will control the size of your navbar/header. There is also an option in the sizes file which can override the auto height inherited from content and specify a fixed height.

Try this in `...src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js` for a big logo:

```
import merge from "deepmerge"
import { BaseTheme } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core"

export default merge(BaseTheme, {
  sizes: {
    headerHeight: "auto", // Provides fallback setting to control header height
    logoWidthSmall: "100px", // Logo width on small screens, up to 768px
    logoWidthMedium: "200px", // Logo width on medium screens, 768px - 1024px
    logoWidthLarge: "300px", // Logo width on large screens, above 1024px
    logoHeightSmall: "100px", // Logo height on small screens, up to 768px
    logoHeightMedium: "200px", // Logo width on medium screens, 768px - 1024px
    logoHeightLarge: "300px", // Logo width on large screens, above 1024px
  },
})
```

### icon.png

There is also a file called icon.png that provides your icon for use in the progressive web app, web browsers and in other locations. This file should be square and at least 512x512px in dimensions.

### seo-default.png

This file is used as the default image in places like Twitter and Facebook. This file is best in a 2:1 aspect ratio, something like 1200x600px. See the [twitter card docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image) for more information.

## Get Building!

Right now the Catalyst themes just provide a starting point, a foundation, on which you can build your own awesome and amazing thing.

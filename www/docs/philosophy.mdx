# Philosophy - Less is More

I created gatsby-theme-catalyst to abstract away the parts of the web development process I did not want to repeat and allow me to focus on the creative and content ends of the work process that I like the most. A way to kick start the development process. It has also served as a great way to learn and grow in my knowledge of React, Javascript, and Node. All of which I knew almost nothing about before starting this project.

You will notice that some of the themes are very unstyled - this is by design as I want to progressively impose and define styles such that it is easier to change for me and end users.

**Core Theme**

This theme acts as a “core” - like a literal foundation, on top of which the other themes are layered. This makes dependency management simpler, upgrade paths easier, and gets rid of some site setup items that need to be repeated.

**Child and Sibling Themes**

These themes extend the core theme and add both function and/or style. Most of these themes are focused more on adding function with the styling being ultimately controlled or modified by theme-ui in the starter sites.

**Starter Sites**

These starter sites implement a set of themes and define some basic styles for them.

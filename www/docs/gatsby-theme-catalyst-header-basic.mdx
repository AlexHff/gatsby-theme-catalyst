# Gatsby-Theme-Catalyst-Header-Basic

**Demo:**[gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic.netlify.com/)

This provides a basic header component that uses component shadowing to hook into the core theme. The header defaults to a logo on the right, nav items on the left. It is responsive and mobile-friendly. It comes with support out of the box for anchor links and smooth scrolling via [react-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll)

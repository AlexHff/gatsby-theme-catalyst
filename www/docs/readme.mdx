# Gatsby Catalyst Themes

The Catalyst series of themes and starters for [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) were designed to provide an opinoinated set of progressive themes and starters that can be used to accelerate web development. The vision is for one "core" theme in which most dependencies and components are contained followed by progressively more styled and refined child themes and starters.

These themes rely heavily on [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/gatsby/). The themes are managed in a [Github monorepo](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst). [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is used for package management, [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) for publishing. [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) is my CMS of choice and is used in some themes that are designed for non-technical end users.

| [gatsby-theme-catalyst-core](/gatsby-theme-catalyst-core)                 | This acts as the core theme on which all other themes are based. It houses a basic site architecture and components along with most commonly needed dependencies. Think of this as the foundation of a home. |
| [gatsby-theme-catalyst-header-basic](/gatsby-theme-catalyst-header-basic) | This adds a simple header to the core theme which includes support for anchor links and smooth scrolling out of the box. Logo on the left, nav on the right.                                                 |
| [gatsby-theme-catalyst-footer-basic](/gatsby-theme-catalyst-footer-basic) | This adds a very basic footer to the core theme.                                                                                                                                                             |
| [gatsby-theme-catalyst-blog](/gatsby-theme-catalyst-blog)                 | [WIP] This will eventually be a plug-and-play blog for any Catalyst based site.                                                                                                                              |
| [gatsby-theme-catalyst-writer](/gatsby-theme-catalyst-writer)             | This is the first complete site using the catalyst set of themes. Designed to be used by a freelance writer as their portfolio. Sanity is used as a CMS.                                                     |

## Demos

[https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer.netlify.com/](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer.netlify.com/)

This starter uses the core theme, header theme, footer theme and then a custom child theme with all the styles and components for the finished website. Sanity.io is used as the CMS.

[https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic.netlify.com/](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic.netlify.com/)

This starter implements just the base core theme, base header, and base footer without any real styling.

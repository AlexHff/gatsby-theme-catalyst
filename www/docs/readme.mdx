# Gatsby Catalyst Themes

The Catalyst series of themes and starters for [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) were designed to provide an opinoinated set of progressive themes and starters that can be used to accelerate web development. The vision is for one "core" theme in which most dependencies and components are contained followed by progressively more styled and refined child themes and starters.

These themes rely heavily on [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started/gatsby/). The themes are managed in a Github monorepo. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is used for package management, [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) for publishing. [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) is my CMS of choice and is used in finished themes designed to be used "out of the box".

[https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer.netlify.com/](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer.netlify.com/)

This starter uses the core theme, header theme, footer theme and then a custom child theme with all the styles and components for the finished website.

[https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic.netlify.com/](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic.netlify.com/)

This starter implements just the base core theme, base header, and base footer without any real styling.

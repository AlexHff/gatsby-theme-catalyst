# Gatsby-Theme-Catalyst-Core

**Demo:** [gatsby-starter-catalyst-core](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-core.netlify.com/)

This acts as a core theme on which all other themes are based. It houses a basic site architecture, as much logic as possible, along with most dependencies. Imagine this as the foundation of a house. There are some latent components which are used to enable easy shadowing in child themes.

# gatsby-theme-catalyst-blog

This theme adds a minimal blogging interface using MDX, similar to `gatsby-theme-blog-core` with some custom modifications. The theme can be added to any existing Catalyst based site and will add blog functionality. It is intended to be extended and customized via component shadowing.

The main features of the blog theme are:

- MDX based authoring
- Minimal set of styles that is intended to be extended and customized through component shadowing of presentation components.
- Support for a featured image on the blog post frontmatter. Improved SEO handling with these images, so when the posts are shared on social media the featured images are used.
- Drafts flag in frontmatter so you can keep posts in your repo that are drafts and not built in the final site.
- Ability to control the excerpt length used in post summaries.
- Reading time support

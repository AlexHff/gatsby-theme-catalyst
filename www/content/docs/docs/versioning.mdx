# Versioning

Themes and starters are follow semantic versioning and are versioned independently.

Anything pre v1.0, e.g. v0.4.3, is in active development however is likely stable enough for experimental use and breaking changes are documented.

Anything pre 0.1.0, e.g. v0.0.4, is in very early development and I would not suggest using it.

Significant changes and feature additions are noted in the `CHANGELOG.md` file. Breaking changes are covered under the [migrating docs](/docs/migrating/).

# Gatsby-Config.js

Site metadata is set via the `gatsby-config.js` file. Specifically the navigation menu, social links menu, author name, site title, etc. The starter sites come with some pre-configured options you can modify. Most of these are fairly standard and where possible I have included inline comments in the starters to help explain if needed. The `socialLinks` object and `menuLinks` object are a bit more complicated to support easier theme customization via the config file.

#### Menu Links

The `menuLinks` is fairly standard with the addition of one field, `type`, which controls whether the menu link is rendered as a Gatsby Link component or an anchor link using `react-scroll`. The options are `internal` or `anchor`.

Example Config:

```js
menuLinks: [
  {
    name: `Page 1`,
    link: `/page-1`,
    type: `internal`, //internal or anchor
  },
  {
    name: `Anchor 1`,
    link: `#anchor-1`,
    type: `anchor`, //internal or anchor
  },
]
```

You can also have a sub-menu or dropdown menu using `gatsby-theme-catalyst-header-top` and `internal` links only. You can see an example of this with `gatsby-starter-catalyst`. Eventually this feature will be expanded to other themes. At present it is _not_ working with anchor links.

Example Config:

```js
menuLinks: [
  {
    name: `Page 1`,
    link: `/page-1`,
    type: `internal`, //internal or anchor
    subMenu: [
      {
        name: `Sub 1`,
        link: `/sub-1`,
        type: `internal`, //internal or anchor
      },
      {
        name: `Sub 2`,
        link: `/sub-2`,
        type: `internal`, //internal or anchor
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

#### Social Links

The `socialLinks` in gatsby-config is a bit unique. You can specify a social media provider such as Twitter and also three different locations in the settings, `header`, `footer`, and `all` which will locate the icons appropriately. It will work with most major social platforms and has a fallback for displaying the text if a logo isn't pre-configured.

Example Config:

```js
socialLinks: [
      {
        name: `Email`,
        link: `eric@erichowey.dev`,
        location: `footer`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
      {
        name: `Github`,
        link: `https://www.github.com/ehowey`,
        location: `all`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
      {
        name: `Twitter`,
        link: `https://www.twitter.com/erchwy`,
        location: `header`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
    ],
```

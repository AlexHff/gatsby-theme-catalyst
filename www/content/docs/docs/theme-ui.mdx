# Theme-UI

Theme-UI based design tokens are used throughout the Catalyst series of themes and starters as this is the suggested best practice when building Gatsby themes. The theme is based on the [tailwind presets](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/tree/master/packages/preset-tailwind) as this provides a good base set of standard spacings, sizings, etc. You will also see a reference to colors like `baseColors.pink[5]` in the theme file, these basecolors can be found on the [TailwindCSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors/).

The file you should modify to set design tokens is always located in the following location:

    .
    ├── src
      ├── gatsby-plugin-theme-ui
        ├── index.js

Try changing some colors in the file and see what happens!

## Variants

Most major areas of the site are preconfigured to use [variants](https://theme-ui.com/guides/variants). This allows you to more easily change css styles without having to shadow a whole file. The following are some of the variants are available to use:

- `variants.siteContainer`: Targets the container for the entire site content
- `variants.main`: Targets the main component in the site, useful for changing spacing between header, footer, and main areas.
- `variants.contentContainer`: Targets the container for the content, useful for changing site margins/content size.
- `variants.header`: Targets the header component
- `variants.footer`: Targets the footer component
- `variants.siteLogo`: Targets the logo component
- `variants.siteTitle`: Targets the root site title component, useful to change font size of the site title.
- `variants.navLink`: Targets the styles for the nav links in the header, useful to change the nav styles
- `variants.navLinkActive`: Targets the styles for the active nav links.

Here is an example of changing the size of the site title using variants.

```js
variants: {
    siteTitle: {
      fontSize: [4, null, null, 5, null],
    },
  },
```

### Breakpoints

Breakpoints are set using Theme-UI theme file and default to 480px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px. The mobile menu is enabled at the 2nd breakpoint, 768px, but you can change this by changing the second breakpoint.

```js
breakpoints: ["480px", "768px", "1024px", "1440px"],
```

The array notation is used to target different screen sizes based on the breakpoints set in the theme file. You can use `null`, to inherit the previous value.

```jsx
<h1
  sx={{
    // 0-479px: Red
    // 480px - 767px: Blue
    // 768px - 1023px: Yellow
    // 1024px - 1439px: Yellow
    // 1440px and up: Pink
    color: ["red", "blue", "yellow", null, "pink"],
  }}
>
  Breakpoints
</h1>
```

### Typography and changing fonts

To add a custom font you need to first add the font as a dependency in your starter site, for example:

`yarn add typeface-raleway`

Then at the top of `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js` file you will need to import the font and declare it, like this for Raleway:

```jsx
import { tailwind } from "@theme-ui/preset-tailwind"
import "typeface-raleway"

export default {
  ...tailwind,
  fonts: {
    ...tailwind.fonts,
    body: '"Raleway", sans-serif',
  },
}
```

### Changing logo sizes

A common change you will need to make is to the logo size.

The logo size is managed in the following location: `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`. In many cases the size of your logo will control the size of your navbar/header. There is also an option in the sizes file which can override the auto height inherited from content and specify a fixed height.

Try this in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js` for a big logo:

```js
  sizes: {
    ...tailwind.sizes,
    maxPageWidth: "1440px", // Sets the max width of elements like the header/footer on really large screens
    maxContentWidth: "720px", // Sets the container size on larger screens, e.g. tablets and laptops
    headerHeight: "auto", // Provides fallback setting to control header height
    logoWidthXS: "80px", // Logo width on extra small screens, up to 480px
    logoWidthS: "150px", // Logo width on small screens, 480px - 768px
    logoWidthM: "150px", // Logo width on medium screens, 768px - 1024px
    logoWidthL: "260px", // Logo width on large screens, 1024px - 1440px
    logoWidthXL: "260px", // Logo width on extra large screens, above 1440px
    logoHeightXS: "80px", // Logo height on extra small screens, up to 480px
    logoHeightS: "150px", // Logo height on small screens, 480px - 768px
    logoHeightM: "150px", // Logo height on medium screens, 768px - 1024px
    logoHeightL: "260px", // Logo height on large screens, 1024px - 1440px
    logoHeightXL: "260px", // Logo height on extra large screens, above 1440px
    iconsFooter: "32px", // Sets the icons size for the footer
    iconsHeader: "20px", // Sets the icons size for the header
  },
```

# Getting Started

These themes are developer focused at this time and I assume you have a basic understanding of Gatsby and modern web development. If you are brand new I recommend beginning with the [getting started docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) for Gatsby and coming back here later!

## Install the themes using a starter

This uses a barebones starter which is designed to be a boilerplate for further development and customization. It includes a minimal set of styles, utility components and core functionality like a mobile navigation menu. Content is authored in MDX.

The themes included in this starter are [gatsby-theme-catalyst-core](/docs/gatsby-theme-catalyst-core), [gatsby-theme-catalyst-header-top](/docs/gatsby-theme-catalyst-header-top), and [gatsby-theme-catalyst-footer](/docs/gatsby-theme-catalyst-footer).

```shell
# create a new Gatsby site using the basic starter
  gatsby new catalyst https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst
# change into your new directory
  cd catalyst
# launch the site
  gatsby develop
```

## Update gatsby-config.js

Open `gatsby-config.js` and update the placeholder data. Most fields are common to other Gatsby sites or documented with inline comments. You can read more about specialized fields like `socialLinks` in the [gatsby-config section](/docs/gatsby-config) of the docs.

## Change your logo and social image

Replace `content/assets/catalyst-site-logo.png`, `content/assets/catalyst-site-social.png`, and `content/assets/catalyst-site-icon.png`. These files need to have the _same name_ but can have different file types, e.g. they could be `.jpg`.

`catalyst-site-logo` is used as the logo on the actual web pages.

`catalyst-site-icon` is used as the icon for the browser and offline mode.

`catalyst-site-social` is used as a fallback social media image if there is not a featured image in the blog post or on a page.

> You can also do this via component shadowing for a custom approach and future releases of Gatsby will enable a better way of doing this with React suspense.

## Create some content

By default content is authored using [MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/). Go to `content/pages/index.mdx` to modify your home page. Note the SEO component on the top of the page which allows you to customize the metadata for each page.

Try pasting in the following code into `index.mdx`:

```md
<SEO title="Home" description="My Home Page"/>

# I am awesome

Yes you are!
```

## Experiment with theme options

You will also notice `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core` accepts a number of theme options which are used as feature flags for the theme. Take a look at the plugin array in `gatsby-config.js` and try changing some of these options.

```js
{
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core`,
      options: {
        //Default options are:
        // contentPath: `content/pages`,
        // assetPath: `content/assets`,
        // displaySiteLogo: true,
        // displaySiteTitle: true,
        // displaySiteLogoMobile: true,
        // displaySiteTitleMobile: true,
        // invertLogo: false,
        // useStickyHeader: false,
        // useSocialLinks: true,
        // useColorMode: true,
        //footerContentLocation: "left", // "left", "right", "center"
      },
    },
```

## Experiment with Theme-UI

Open `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`.

This is where you modify and change the theming for your site. You can read more about the [integration with Theme-UI](/docs/theme-ui) in the docs.

Try copy and pasting the following code into your theme file to see what happens.

```js
import { merge } from "theme-ui"
import { BaseTheme } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core"

export default merge(BaseTheme, {
  // Modifications to the base theme go here. This is an example changing colors and using variants to change your navigation links. Uncomment the code below to see what happens.
  colors: {
    background: "pink",
    modes: {
      dark: {
        background: "purple",
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    navLinks: {
      border: "5px solid red",
    },
  },
})
```

## Experiment with switching headers by switching themes

An integrated set of themes enables the power to dramatically change whole aspects of the design by just swapping out themes. This still an emerging area in Gatsby Theme Catalyst but it is interesting to see the opportunities this pattern enables in site design.

Goto `gatsby-config.js` and change your header just by changing the plugins array.

```js
plugins: [
    ...
    `gatsby-theme-catalyst-header-side`, // Remove gatsby-theme-catalyst-header-top
    ...
],
```

## Get building

This should give you an idea of what is possible with Gatsby Theme Catalyst and the launching pad it can provide when developing your own Gatsby site.

You can read more in the documentation about [further customizing](/docs/configuring-themes) your themes and site. For an example of a styled and complete site check out [gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen](/docs/gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen) which adds a both a data layer (SANITY.io) and a presentation layer on top of the base starter covered here.

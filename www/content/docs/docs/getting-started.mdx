# Getting Started

These themes are developer focused and I assume you have a basic knowledge of the command line, GatsbyJS, web development, git, etc. If you are brand new check out the [getting started docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) for GatsbyJS.

## Install the themes using a basic starter

This uses a basic starter which is designed to be a boilerplate for further development and customization. It intentionally includes a minimal set of styles so that you do not have to "un-do" too much as a developer.

```shell
# create a new Gatsby site using the basic starter
  gatsby new catalyst https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst
# change into your new directory
  cd catalyst
# launch the site
  gatsby develop
```

## Update gatsby-config.js

Update `siteMetadata` to include your own details, e.g. the site title. The starter has some preset placeholder data you can change.

You will also notice `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core` accepts a number of theme options which are used as feature flags for the theme. Take a look at the plugin array and try toggling some of these feature flags on and off.

```js
{
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-catalyst-core`,
      options: {
        //Default options are:
        // contentPath: `content/pages`,
        // assetPath: `content/assets`,
        // displaySiteLogo: true,
        // displaySiteTitle: true,
        // displaySiteLogoMobile: true,
        // displaySiteTitleMobile: true,
        // invertLogo: false,
        // useStickyHeader: false,
        // useSocialLinks: true,
        // useColorMode: true,
        //footerContentLocation: "left", // "left", "right", "center"
      },
    },
```

## Update your branding

Replace `content/assets/catalyst-site-logo.png`, `content/assets/catalyst-site-social.png`, and `content/assets/catalyst-site-icon.png`. These files need to have the _same name_ but can have different file types, e.g. they could be `.jpg`. Because we cannot currently (this will change) pass query variables in to GraphQL with Gatsby this is a workaround to allow you to easily change icons and logos on the site. If you are comfortable with file shadowing you could also just shadow `useSiteMetadata.js` and replace the image queries with your own.

`catalyst-site-logo` is used as the logo on the actual web pages.

`catalyst-site-icon` is used as the icon for the browser and offline mode.

`catalyst-site-social` is used as a fallback social media image if there is not a featured image in the blog post or on a page.

## Change the Theme-UI theme

Open `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`. This is where you modify and change the theming for Theme-UI. There is some commented code in there you can uncomment to see what happens. You will also notice a field called `variants`. Catalyst makes heavy use of [variants](https://theme-ui.com/guides/variants) throughout to allow you to change some aspects of the design and appearance without having to directly modify the file.

```js
import { merge } from "theme-ui"
import { BaseTheme } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core"

export default merge(BaseTheme, {
  // Modifications to the base theme go here. This is an example changing colors and using variants to change your navigation links. Uncomment the code below to see what happens.
  colors: {
    background: "pink",
    modes: {
      dark: {
        background: "purple",
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    siteTitle: {
      fontSize: [3, 4, null, 5, null],
    },
  },
})
```

## Change the site header by switching themes

An integrated set of themes allows the ability to change whole aspects of the design by swapping out themes. Goto `gatsby-config.js` and change your header by changing the plugins array.

```js
plugins: [
    ...
    `gatsby-theme-catalyst-header-side`, // Changed from header-top
    ...
],
```

## Get building

This gives you an idea of what is possible with Gatsby Theme Catalyst and a launching pad for developing your own site. You can read more in the documentation about further customizing your themes and site. For an example of a styled and complete site check out [gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen](/docs/gatsby-theme-catalyst-hydrogen) which adds a data layer with SANITY.io and finished theming and components.
